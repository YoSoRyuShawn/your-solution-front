# Hey, Doc! (Front End)

Welcome to the back-end repository for our Progressive Web App called, "Hey, Doc!" This is our solution to helping English-speakers in Japan who want to overcome the language barrier and find doctors that they can easily communicate with. The best part about is that they never have to leave home!
